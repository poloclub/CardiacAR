## Feature Highlights

### Importing and Repositioning Model

Import custom heart models for patient-specific analysis and anchor them anywhere in the AR space.

### Panning, Scaling, and Perspective View

Using CardiacAR, you can pan, rotate, and scale the model for better angles. You can also move your device through the model by moving it in the physical space to obtain a perspective view of the model.

### Omni-directional

Explore various cross sectional view of the model to better understand the anatomy of the heart model. Implement multiple slices in any direction to better analyze the model. Preview the slices before confirming them using the "Confirm Slice" button.

### Virtual Annotation
Attach a sticky note to the model and anchor it to any point on the model to quickly emphasize and organize information during a planning session.
