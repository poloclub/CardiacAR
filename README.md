## Feature Highlights

### Importing and Repositioning Model

Import your own custom heart models and reposition them in the physical space!

### Panning, Scaling, and Perspective View

Using CardiacAR, you can pan, rotate, and scale the model for better angles. You can also move your device through the model by moving it in the physical space to obtain a perspective view of the model.

### Model Slicing

Explore various cross sections of the model to beter understand the details of the heart model. Implement multiple slices and cross sections to narrow your field of view. Preview the slices before confirming them using the "Confirm Slice" button.
